a disk image is a clone of a disk, or hard drive.
when you clone it with the command:
dd if=?dev/sda of=suspiciousdrive.img
you get an .img file.
you then mount the file with the command:
mount -t vfat -o ro,noexec /dev/fd0 /mnt/analysis
disk partitions are sections of the disk with allocated memory. kinda like a big folder.
there are as many disk partitions in a disk image as the user wants there to be. usually 1-3.
when you mount a disk image, you only mount one partition if there is more than one. That can be an issue.
In order to work around this issue, you have to find the bit locations of the start of each partition.
