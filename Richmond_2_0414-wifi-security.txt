Hackers can use public wifi to easily hack into your computer.

Using a vpn is an easy solution to security on public networks.

Virtual Private Networ(VPN) is a secure connection that puts a mask on your 
computer and encrypts all outgoing data. 
VPNs are not very complicated to setup but they usually require a dedicated server to 
access. VPNs are essential for hiding sensitive information using public internet 
connections.
