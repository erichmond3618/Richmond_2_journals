3. Whatever the command did the answer is false cause its a 0.

4. making it1 makes it true.

5. apt-get install Zenmap, apt-get update

6. Everything is closed.

7. for 10, there were less closed thigns, for 100, there were no closed things

8. I got this- 
Starting Nmap 6.49BETA4 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2016-02-24 11:06 EST
about a minute later i got a bunch of these-
Nmap scan report for 10.4.27.15
Host is up (0.00043s latency).
Not shown: 98 closed ports
PORT    STATE SERVICE
22/tcp  open  ssh
111/tcp open  rpcbind

9. Searching for computers and networks and such is important for getting
the bad guys.

10. an OS is an Operating System.

11. It's good to know what OS computers are running cause they're all 
different and you gotta do different stuff to access them or something.

12.nmap -O 10.4.27.1-100

13.10.4.27.22?

14.

15. nmap --iflist does this- Starting Nmap 6.49BETA4 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2016-02-25 10:45 EST

16.ipv4 addresses- 

17.ipv6 addresses- 

18. the difference is 

19. Its good to get a picture of what the network looks like, so you know
what your dealing with, ya kno. and you can easily see which computers are
connected to which.
