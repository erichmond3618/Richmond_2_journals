No, one who goes home and works for hours on linux and networking does not 
describe me, cause I do not know much about these things, and they are not my
passion. I'm pretty good at problem solving. I don't know how I'm supposed to 
prove that here. I got a 2040 on the SAT, and thats a logic test. Also I'm 
pretty good at Dr.Robotniks mean bean machine. I have not finished my disk
image, because I need to learn how to use imagemagick.
