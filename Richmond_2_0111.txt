1. mmls -t dos newfloppy.img doesn't have magic values or something
3. mmls -t dos manypartitions3.disk acually shows imformation. it says its a 
Dos Partion Table, and there is a table of information.
4. the first column is Slot.
5. some possible values for Slot are Meta, -----, or 00:01, 00:02, etc. these 
are the placements of the partitions.
6. mmls -t list tells you the supported partition types
7. raw, aff, afd, afm, afflib, ewf, and split seem to ber file types that are
used in digital forensics.
8. I don't believe this is a question.
9. mmls manypartitions3.disk does the same thing as mmls -t dos, as it 
autodetects the type as being dos.
10. mmlls -a seems to just show the actual partitions on disk, this excludes
the slots named ----- and Meta.
11.fdisk -lu manypartitions3.disk is pretty similar to mmls -a, it has 2 extra
columns though, size and Id.
