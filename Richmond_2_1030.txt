because disk images are nice, digital representations of real drives, 
that you can send over email, or examine without messing with the original 
evidence.
So like, you have 20 hard drives,and you need a digital forensicist to take
a look at em, so you make images out of all of em, and you email em. Then
 the forensicist mounts the drive and checks it out.

mkdir directory
mount -v -o -t ext4 img.img /mnt/

fallocate -l 10M file.out
cp /fileplace/file /newfileplace
