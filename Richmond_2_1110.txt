To recover deleted pictures, use the programs mentioned below.
Foremost, photorec, and The Sleuth Kit were suggested by people on askubuntu
for recovering deleted pictures. I don't know how to use them, nor do I have 
them installed, but I could install these programs and learn how to use them.
You need to know how to use these programs, and where the deleted file is 
in order to recover it.
