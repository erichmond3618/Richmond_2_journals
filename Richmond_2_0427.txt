WEP is vulnerable for many reasons. sometimes people forget to enable it. some people 
dont change the password often so someone can grab all the frames he needs to crack it. 
The IV is too small and clear text, the IV is static, the IV makes the key stream 
vulnerable.

the network traffic will increase slowing down the network If your WEP has been 
compromised.

to protect your network, change your password often, or dont use WEP. we have better 
security options.
