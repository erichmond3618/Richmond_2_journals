1. Before this class I thought Digital Forensics Investigators recovered 
files and such from the computers. Thats basically what we do, I just had no
idea how.

2. I didnt sign up for this class. I was put into it. I thought it was cool so
I stayed. We get to learn how to recover files.

3. Digital Forensics Investigators look like normal people typing in a command
line.

4. I'm assuming those unfamiliar with digital forensics would think more 
keyboards make you hack faster and there are a lot of graphs and stuff when 
you recover files.

5. Eh. I'd rather do something else. Digital Forensics is pretty tedious,
but I'm glad I have some basic knowledge in this field in case I need to 
recover some flash files or something.

6. If a friend asked me, I'd tell em to take a digital forensics class 
and see how they like it.
