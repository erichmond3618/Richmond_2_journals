We went to rackspace, ate some donuts, got some swag, then watched a 
presentation talking about what rackspace was, and ADI I think. I watched 
the presentation on networking, and it all went way over my head. I'm 
definetly not going to go into networking. we watched another presentation
dealio about how to work for rackspace basically. Then we ate pizza.
we went on speed dates with a bunch of people from rackspace, they told us
theyre tale of how they came to work for rackspace, and what they do. We also
went on a tour of the castle and went down a slide. I learned that networking 
is complicated and I'm going to go ahead and be an electrical engineer.
