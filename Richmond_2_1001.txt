file sytems are is used to decide how files are logically placed for storage and retrieval.

inodes are data structures that store all the information about a file, besides its name and actual data.

disk partitions are parts of the hard drive allocated for different files and such. Theyre kinda like big files.

Journaling file systems keep track of changes not yet committed to the main part of the file system, so in the case of a system crash those changes will be remembered.
