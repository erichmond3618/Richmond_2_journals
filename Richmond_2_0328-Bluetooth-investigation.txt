Bluehacking, bluejacking, marphing, bluesniping, and bluesnafting are just
a few of the names given to the act of hacking a device via Bluetooth.
Most of the tools that are being used to hack Bluetooth phones use the Java 
programming language.
Bluebugging: An extraordinarily powerful attack mechanism, 
bluebugging allows an attacker to
 take control of a victim's phone 
using the AT command parser. Bluebug 
allows an attacker to access a 
victim's phone in order to make
 phone calls, send short message 
service (SMS) messages,
 read SMS messages stored on the phone, 
read and write contact list entri
es, alter phone service parameters, 
connect to the Internet, set call forwarding, and more (Bluebugging, 
n.d.; Laurie et al., 2006). 
•
Bluejacking: The sending of unsolicited messages to open Bluetooth 
devices by sending a vCard with a message in the name field and 
exploiting the OBEX protocol (Bluejacking, 2009). 
•
Bluesmack: A Bluetooth analog of the Ping-of-Death denial-of-service 
attack. This is a buffer overflow attack using L2CAP echo messages 
(Bluesmack, n.d.; Laurie, 2006)
