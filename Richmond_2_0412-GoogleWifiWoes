Google had been "mistakenly collecting samples of payload data from open 
(i.e. non-password-protected) Wi-Fi networks" for three years.

they used an edited kismet that discarded encrypted information.

Google passively scanned with their google cars. They were able to pick up
payload data from wifi hotspots.

Eh. Google is pretty sketch, but it doesn't seem like they can do a whole lot
with unencrypted bits and pieces of payload data from starbucks laptops.
