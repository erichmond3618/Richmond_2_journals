Hello, I'm a corporate digital forensics investigator. When I got hacked I 
dedicated my life to stopping the hackers. My network got hacked real hard
last week. One of my crap employees got an email that was clearly suspicious,
that looked like it was from me. I saw it on his computer while walking by
his office and told him that wasn't me, delete the email. Then the day was 
saved.
