Generalizing a skill is basically taking a skill and making it usefull in more situations.
An Example would be learning to recover png files, then, to generalize the skill 
to recovering a lot of file types, learning the the differences between recovering 
a png, a pdf, a doc, etc. 

five likely questions on the final exam:
what does grep do?
grep is used mainly to find text in files.
how do you mount an image?
you mount an image with the command mnt image.img /mnt/folder/
how do you split a file?
split -n 3 /folder/place name_
how do recover a jpg?
xxd image.raw | grep ffd8
echo "ibase=16;<location of header in hex>" | bc
xxd -s <location in dec> image.raw | grep ffd9
echo "ibase=16;<location of tail in hex>" | bc
echo "<tail> - <header>" | bc
dd if=image.raw of=picture.jpg skip= <header> bs=1 count=<tail-header>
how do you unmount an image?
umount /mnt/folder/

You should ask these questions cause they are important in digital forensics.
