First we search for the start of the picture(its header) We search for its header by using the command xxd
Then we grep to find the line.
Using the value from that - we use echo and bc to convert hexidecimal to a decimal number.
For example, in the example from yesterday, we found the jpeg header and converted it to decimal using the command echo "ibase=16; 00052A0" | bc
Then to find the end of the file, we searched for the end of the file using the command xxd -s 21156 image_carve.raw | grep ffd9
******************************************************
Using that information, we find the number of bits, using the command echo "ibase=16;0006C74" | bc
Then using dd we can reconstruct the file using the command dd if=image_carve.raw of=carv.jpg skip=21156 bs=1 count=6610
